    <p class="mission">"Turning my love for technology into a career, with a goal to reach both innovation and ambition."</p>
    <p class="yap">I originally wanted to take computer science; however, through enough persuasion, my mother convinced me to take computer engineering instead, following the footsteps of my uncle, who is also a computer engineer. Since they aren't too far apart, my goal is to learn coding and develop a career as a website designer, game developer, or as a cybersecurity professional. However, that is my secondary goal; my main goal is to attain a bachelor's degree in science as a requirement for an airline pilot. I am still, however, passionate about computer engineering. </p>
