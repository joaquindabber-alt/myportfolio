    <p class="alp">My name is Christof Joaquin S. Musico, I am from Parañaque city, and I'm an ice hoceky play. I finished my senior high school at Mapúa University.
        <p>Growing up, my parents owned an internet cafe. From there, I would often spend my hours playing games. One game that captivated me the most was Roblox. Roblox is a platform where you can take your imagination to life by creating games that anyone else to can experience through coding, more specifically, Lua coding, which is where my sudden passion for coding began. I was eager to learn but never knew where to start — until I learned about computer engineering. And that's how I found my path.</p>
        <p>Finished 3rd place in Division B Chilla in Manila 2 (2025) with the Bangkok Kings, Competed for the U18 National Ice Hockey Team in Thailand (2024)</p>
